# Challenge4 Console Finance

Description
The aim of this challenge was to create javascript code for analyzing the financial records of a company.

Using the data set provided, I created code to generate the total number of months, the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period, the average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period, to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

This challenge helped me learn about and how to use javascript code.

The finer details of what I have learnt include:-
<ul>
 <li> Declaring variables </li>
  <li>Targeting and adding together numbers within a 2D array </li>
  <li> Creating for loops </li>
  <li> Creating if statements </li>
  <li> Creating code to perform mathmatic functions </li>
  <li> Console logging the results and presenting the data in a user friendly format </li>

Technologies used:- MAC Terminal, VS Code and Git Hub.
